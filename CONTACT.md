# Inquiries

If you're exploring a pilot, integration, or evaluation of Program Totality Analyzer, send a note with:

1. **Organization type** (enterprise tech team, consulting firm, security/compliance team, etc.)
2. **What problem you're trying to solve** (1–2 sentences)
3. **Data sensitivity constraints** (proprietary code analysis, internal-only deployment, etc.)
4. **Deployment preference** (cloud / on-prem / hybrid)
5. **Timeline** (exploratory, active evaluation, urgent need)
6. **Budget range** (optional)

**Email:** [Your business email placeholder — update before going live]

## What happens next

* We'll respond within 2 business days with initial fit assessment
* For qualified inquiries, we'll schedule a demo and technical walkthrough
* Pilot programs include integration support and customization guidance
* Full deployment includes documentation, training, and operational handoff

## What we need to know

To prepare a relevant demo or pilot scope:

* **Repository count and size** — how many repos, typical codebase size
* **Tech stack** — languages, frameworks, infrastructure-as-code tools
* **Compliance requirements** — SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, or other mandates
* **Integration constraints** — existing CI/CD pipelines, access control policies
* **Expected output consumers** — who will use the analysis results (engineers, compliance teams, executives)

## Not ready for full inquiry?

If you're just exploring capabilities, review:

* **PUBLIC.md** — full capability overview and use cases
* **docs/QUICKSTART.md** — installation and basic usage (if self-evaluation is an option)
* **docs/API.md** — API endpoint documentation for integration planning

We're happy to answer general questions before formal inquiry. Send a note with your specific question.
